# DirSync-Mongo-Agent-AD-MongoDB-AI-Sidecar
Synchronize users, groups, and memberships from customer Active Directory (LDAP/LDAPS) into MongoDB with idempotent bulk upserts, incremental watermarks, and an AI (RAG) sidecar that proposes per‑tenant mapping plans (human‑approved) to handle schema drift. Designed with Akamai‑style multi‑tenant needs in mind.
